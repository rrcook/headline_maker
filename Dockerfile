# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
# Build stage for the content-batch image: a self-contained mix release of the
# headline generator.
#
# This image is not meant to run on its own - content-batch assembles it:
#   COPY --from=<this> /app/_build/prod/rel/headline_maker ...
#
# Unlike weather_overlay there are no native dependencies, so the release is
# the whole story. It does need network at build time: naplps_writer and
# prodigy_objects are git deps.

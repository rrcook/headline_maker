  @moduledoc """
  A local ollama server, the original (and default) summarizer.

  Host comes from `OLLAMA_HOST`, model from `OLLAMA_MODEL`; both keep the
  values that were hardcoded before this became pluggable.

  `configured?/0` is always true: ollama needs no credential, and probing the
  host here would just duplicate the request `complete/1` is about to make. An
  unreachable server surfaces as a connection error, which moves the chain on
  to the next provider.

  @moduledoc """
  Anthropic's Messages API - the hosted option for hosts that cannot run a
  local model.

  Needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; without it `configured?/0` is false and the chain
  moves on without a request. `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` overrides the model.

  Two details worth knowing:

  * Effort is set to `low` rather than turning thinking off. Thinking is on by
    default on this model family, and disabling it is the discouraged route -
    lowering effort is the supported way to keep a simple task cheap.
  * News copy can trip the safety classifiers. A refusal is not an HTTP error:
    it arrives as a 200 with `stop_reason` of `refusal`, so that case is checked
    explicitly and turned into an error, which lets the chain (and ultimately
    the trim path) take over. Server-side fallbacks are enabled as well, so a
    refusal is usually re-routed before it ever reaches us.

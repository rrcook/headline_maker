  Turns a day's plan into the Page Element Objects the service serves.

  ## One object per page

  Every recovered HEADLINE NEWS body is `sequence 1` of `set_size 1` with its
  own id - NH00A3XY, NH00CF4J, NH00CF4K - so the service did not page through
  element sets here. Each screen is its own object, and the base-36 id is a
  page counter: CF4J and CF4K are adjacent because they were allocated one
  after the other.

  ## NEXT chains through the menu, not through a set

  A body's standard menu carries the next page in its third parameter. That is
  the whole reason NH00CF4JB has a menu at all - its choice and action lists
  are empty, and P3 names CF4K. So every page gets a menu, whether or not it
  has numbered links, and the last page of a chain simply has nothing in P3.

  ## How a subordinate link reaches its page

  An action navigates to the SHARED page template and passes the body to
  display as a destination parameter. One template serves every screen, told
  each time which element to show, so no page template is generated here.

  ## Object ids

  Digit-leading ids are structural - NH000000 the page template, NH000251 the
  header - and letter-leading ids are content. A000 is the conventional first
  content id and is what the recovered page template already points at, so the
  first story keeps it; every page after that takes the next id in turn.

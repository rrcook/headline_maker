  Pluggable text summarization, in the same shape as `NewsFeeds`: a behaviour
  with swappable implementations chosen at the command line.

  A local ollama is ideal when the host can run one, but an 8B model needs
  around 6 GB resident and some deployment targets cannot spare it. So the
  provider is a chain, tried in order:

      --summarizer ollama,anthropic    local first, hosted API if it is not there
      --summarizer anthropic           hosted API only
      --summarizer none                no LLM at all

  The default is `ollama` alone, which is exactly the behavior before this
  module existed.

  The chain is explicit on purpose - probing for a local ollama and silently
  falling back would mean an unattended daily run produces different prose
  depending on what happened to be reachable, with nothing in the output saying
  which path ran. Every summary logs the provider that produced it.

  When no provider in the chain succeeds, `summarize/2` returns
  `{:error, :no_provider}`, and each caller decides what that is worth:

  * `NewsEditor.fit_text/4`, asking for an over-long story to be shortened,
    logs the failure and keeps the text it has - the renderer then wraps it,
    and the page runs long rather than the run failing.
  * `NewsEditor.plan/2`, asking for the whole page plan, has nothing to fall
    back on, so the run exits without writing and the service keeps serving
    yesterday's tree.
  * `HeadlineWriter.choose_summary/3` trims the original to length, but that
    is the older whole-page path and no longer runs - see its moduledoc.

  This module owns the prompt so that every provider sends an identical
  instruction and their outputs stay comparable; implementations only carry it
  to a model and hand back text.

  The prompt for one piece of text, shared by every provider so that swapping
  providers changes the model and not the instruction.

  Two things the wording has to get right, both learned the hard way:

  * The limit is stated as hard, and the target set below `max_length`. Asking
    for something "close to" a maximum reliably lands just over it, and the
    caller is then left trimming what came back.
  * The real work on a wire feed is not compression. Story text arrives with
    photo captions, agency credits, datelines, network boilerplate, duplicated
    sentences, and the lede several paragraphs down. Asking only for a summary
    does not ask for any of that to be fixed.

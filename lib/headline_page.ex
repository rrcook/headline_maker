  @moduledoc """
  Draws a HEADLINE NEWS body: a story over a list of subordinate story links.

  The geometry is derived from the traced originals NH00A000.B01 (four links)
  and .B02 (one link); see the applications-trial plan
  `headline-news-body-templates.md` for how each number was arrived at. Every
  measurement keys off the link count, because the link block is anchored to
  the bottom of the panel and grows upward into the story's space.

  This module produces the NAPLPS for the page and the field definitions that
  make the links selectable. It does not decide what the links point at - that
  is navigation wiring on the page template, not presentation.

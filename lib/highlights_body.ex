defmodule HighlightsBody do
  @moduledoc """
  Builds `TLOTA000B` - the body of the post-login HIGHLIGHTS page.

  HIGHLIGHTS is a page template (`TLOT0011PG`) that calls four elements by
  name. Only one of them carries the option list, so changing the landing page
  means regenerating exactly this object and nothing else.

  ## Why it is generated here

  Option 1 announces the day's lead story and links to HEADLINE NEWS, so it
  changes whenever the headlines do. Emitting it alongside the `NH00*` objects
  puts both in the same all-on-nothing upload set, which is the only way the
  landing page and the headline chain cannot disagree about what the lead
  story is.

  ## How it is built

  Not re-authored - patched. The recovered original is carried in `priv/` in
  two pieces:

    * `tlota000b.obj` - the packed 1124-byte object, byte-identical to the
      copy recovered from the service.
    * `tlota000b.td`  - its NAPLPS, decompiled to Telidraw source, with the
      six option text blocks replaced by a `@@SLOTS@@` marker.

  Generation substitutes the marker, transpiles back to NAPLPS, and splices
  the result into the original object in place of its presentation segment.
  Everything we do not fully understand - the field attributes and their
  cursor bytes, the custom_text segment, the whole 188-byte XXOPSM00
  parameter block and the XXOPSM01 post-processor call - survives untouched.

  `TelidrawTranspiler` round-trips the untouched original to the same 723
  bytes it started from, which is what makes this safe; `highlights_body_test`
  asserts it.

  ## Retargeting

  Only two of the nine destinations move, and both names are 11 characters, so
  they are substituted in place with no reframing:

      5C000000PG -> ZZAB0000PG   option 2, now Welcome / short history
      FN000000PG -> ZZPR0000P    option 3, the Prodigy Reloaded featurette
      SJ000000PG -> 3C00SRCHPG   option 4, the Software Guide
      AT000000PG -> GCC00000PG   option 5, the Computer Club bulletin board

  Options 4 and 5 were placeholder ideas from the first exhibit build and had
  no objects behind them at all. They now reach real content.

  Option 1 keeps the original's `NH000000PG`, which is also where the
  HEADLINES keyword lands.

  ## The slot-1 budget

  The text box is `field 35,131 102x30` and the original fills it with three
  lines whose longest is exactly 17 characters ("Hostage Execution"). 102/17
  is 6 and 30/3 is 10, so the cell is 6x10 MONOSPACE and the budget is a hard
  17 columns by 3 rows. The proportional metrics in `NaplpsText` do not apply
  to this slot - wrapping here is plain character counting.

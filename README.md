# Headline Maker 

Headline Maker is a command-line program to collect news stories and prepare them for publishing in the Prodigy Service client application.
It uses news stories to make a headline and story, then creates Prodigy object files that is put in the Prodigy Reloaded database to be served by the Prodigy Reloaded server.

Different news services are picked with "pluggable" built-in news gathering libraries. 

## Usage

```sh
headline_maker [options]

| `--attribution`       | `-a`  | string  | Adds the attribution string to the end of a story's headline.                                |
| `--help`              | `-h`  | boolean | Show help message and exit.                                                                  |

| `--debugoutput`       |       | string  | Debug output file (no alias).                                                                |

## Example

```sh
./headline_maker -i https://memeorandum.com/feed.xml -d /tmp/headlines -o NH00A000.BDY
```

## Help

To display the help message, use:

```sh
headline_maker --help
```

## Notes

- All options except `--help` have sensible defaults.
- Debug options do not have short aliases.
- If `--debuginput` is specified, the feed style is overridden to use `DebugFeed`, which just reads in the files from the debuginput directory.

## Summarization

Story text is summarized to fit the page. The summarizer is pluggable, in the
same way feeds are, and is given as a chain tried in order:

| Name | Needs | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| `ollama` | a reachable ollama server | Default. `OLLAMA_HOST`, `OLLAMA_MODEL` |
| `anthropic` (alias `claude`) | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` |
| `gemini` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | `GEMINI_MODEL` |
| `none` | nothing | Declines every prompt - see the note below |

```sh
# local model, falling back to the API on a host that cannot run one
headline_maker -s ollama,anthropic

# no model at all - stories are trimmed to length
headline_maker -s none
```

The chain can also be set with the `SUMMARIZER` environment variable; the
command line wins. Each summary logs which provider produced it, so an
unattended run can be traced after the fact.

A model is not optional for a whole run. Choosing and ranking the day's
stories is itself an editorial pass (`NewsEditor.plan/2`), and it has no
non-model fallback: if every provider in the chain is unconfigured or fails,
the run writes nothing and the service keeps serving yesterday's tree. Where a
failure *is* survivable is shortening an over-long story - there the text is
kept as written and the page simply runs long.
